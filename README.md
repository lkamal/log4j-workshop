This project contains 10 Java eclipse based projects on log4j. You can use the projects in the numbering order used in project names.

First you must download or checkout this github project.

Then you need to import these 10 projects into Eclise via: 

File->Import-> General -> ‘Existing Projects into Workspace’; and select the log4j_worksphop folder. 

Further help on importing is [available here](http://help.eclipse.org/juno/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.platform.doc.user%2Ftasks%2Ftasks-importproject.htm).
